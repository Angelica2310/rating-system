  "description": "Software Development Bootcamp - Week 8 project - Build a Comment Form using Next.js ## What requirements did you achieve? - Users can view all brands on the page and click on their favourite brand for more information. These data are fetched from database. Each brand has comments which also retrieved from the database. - The App has a dynamic metadata name. - The App contains a home page - a 404 error linked to the All Brand Page. - UI layout changes depending on screen size. ### Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve? - Create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database. - Create a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key. - Allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments should be associated with posts, and have a dynamic route (e.g. /posts/:postid). - Add a redirect when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page. ### If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? I feel a bit confused about how Next.js works, especially the distinction between \"Client\" and \"Server.\" I'm really frustrated with this week's project because I had been doing so well from the beginning. I consistently completed assignments beyond expectations, even achieving the stretch goals. However, for some reason, I just can't seem to complete this week's assignment, and I don't understand why.",
